InventoryScout

This project will be a web app that can locate items to pull in the shipping department at the warehouse I work at. This is a personal project to benefit myself and my close coworkers. 

This app will handle tracking the stock and help the Shipping crew find the most efficient method of pulling the orders for the day. The idea of this is to be a system that increases efficiency by cutting down the time required to find and figure out how to pull things quickly as possible, which is arguably half of the job. It will have a robust user interface and simple controls that will allow easy use by anyone on the job.

This project is in its early stages and I am currently working on a proof of concept.
